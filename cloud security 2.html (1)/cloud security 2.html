        <h2>Principles of Cloud Security</h2>
        <p>Cloud security is guided by <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles" target="_blank">established principles</a> designed to protect data, applications, and services. Key principles include data protection, secure user management, operational security, and availability. Shared responsibility between the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-cloud-service-provider" target="_blank">cloud service provider</a> and the customer is critical for success. Security mechanisms like <a href="https://www.akamai.com/glossary/what-is-cloud-mfa#:~:text=Multi%2Dfactor%20authentication%20(MFA)%20is%20a%20powerful%20identity%20and,work%2C%20and%20play%20every%20day." target="_blank">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, role-based access control (RBAC), and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-cloud-encryption" target="_blank">encryption</a> further enhance protection by reducing the risk of breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
