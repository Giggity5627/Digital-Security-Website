            <h2>What Is Data Protection?</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

            </div>
            <p>Many hackers and spies roam around the Internet to intercept any data being sent over from different networks so they can use it for their gain. These people would often steal data to compromise one person or an entire group run by them, simply so their benefits can rise or to create chaos for the sake of it, forcing us to rely on data protection to safeguard this. Data Protection is a method used online hindering the chances leakers have accessing personal information to fulfill any goal they had in mind, making your data more safe to travel across the Internet unharmed.</p>

            <h2>The Extent Of Damage Hackers Can Cause</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="HackerProfit.jpg" alt="HackerProfit" />
            </div>
            <p>Not only do these hackers target any individual people, but many of their targets involve their victims being involved in a corporation that is a direct competitor to any business that the hacker may be involved in, or simply as put it, apart of no group at all and simply wants to ruin the company's image. Although companies are mighty in wealth, data breaches are likely to occur with them, as security breaches cost "more than $3.8 million on average, and over the next 24 months, more than one-quarter of businesses will experience a recurring material breach" (Bonderud 2019), signifying how companies do not take immediate action to address their information being leaked. A list below includes some reasons why companies do not implement an official data protection hub, which is not limited to, but includes...</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expanding attack surfaces:</strong> Douglas Bonderud's article, "What Is Data Protection And Why Does It Matter?", explains that attack surfaces (which are essentially entry points to hack information from) are too far and wide for even the most experienced IT Team to handle with. The IT Team being too small allows several hackers to leak information about the company undetected.</li>
                <li><strong>Similar vulnerabilities:</strong> Some vulnerabilities that many companies share in common relating to the IT Department is rather the lack of a highly experienced or required team of technological experts needed to fix any system networks as the Internet expands further beyond the small team of IT workers.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolving privacy and reporting requirements:</strong> Consumers often assume that companies take steps to prevent any data breaches, however, it has been noted that "new breach reporting regulations demand speedy user notification and auditable proof that companies are effectively securing personally identifiable information" (Bonderud 2019), meaning that companies are legally required to tell the customer if their data is covered or not, which could harm the company's valuation due to lack of customer support should they be disclosed of this.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing IoT and mobile adoption:</strong> Last, but not least, a growing amount of people have been bringing their mobile smartphones to work despite the risk of their personal information [and the entire business's information] becoming compromised by hackers, only adding more to the problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How To Use Data Protection To The Maximum</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="DataLock.jpg" alt="DataLock" />
            </div>
            <p>Although these hackers are intimidating to encounter, even when you least expect it, there are several ways in which they can be deterred so your transferred data can have a more minimal chance of running into such hackers. These methods are designed to transfer data (assuming you are in a safe network) to reach your destination without being picked up or even hacked into by foreigners on the Internet. Using those strategies can help deliver your data in a much more timely manner with less chance of compromising your [and everyone else's] data. Below is a table paraphrasing Microsoft's recommendations on which data protection services are best in general. It is up to you to decide which service works best for your data and your computer.</p>

                <tr>
                    <td>This solution helps you monitor the people you are associated with much more carefully, giving your permission to block any data transfers.</td>
                    <td>Using the replication method copy data from one location and store that copy at another location in case your data is taken down. It also could be allowed for that copied data to be shared with other people nearby you.</td>

                    <td>Adding more layers of data protection allows you to recover the original data under the scenario that the original data was deleted or modified. For example, locking the data in storage accounts makes it only readable and unmodifiable.</td>
                    <td>A firewall only prevents unauthorized users from accessing the system network or your computer, by monitoring and filtering network traffic based on the established rules set on your computer. It also helps against viruses or malware. You can modify the rules of the firewall to the best extent.</td>

Snapshots have arrays that create points that list out the data's location and set it to read-only. They can also include system configs to recover any servers.</td>

            <h2>What's In The Future For Data Protection?</h2>
            <p>As technology advances, so will laws about data protection requirements too. Right now, more laws are being passed throughout the nation about data protection, ensuring that all the stored data people have will be protected against people who may take that data for any nefarious usage. For example, TechTarget's article about data protection includes a section about data protection laws, stating that laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) "have forced businesses to change the way they collect, process, store and eventually erase their data" (Karjian 2024), showing how certain state governments are taking action to protect the privacy of consumers so they wouldn't be taken advantage of. In addition, should these companies step out of line and not disclose their data practices to consumers, they could face financial consequences for breaking such laws. Recently, US Congress passed the American Privacy Rights Act of 2024 which would address the trend of data privacy to make all national data safe with set standards.</p>
